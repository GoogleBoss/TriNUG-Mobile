## Contributing
This is an open project.  Here's how to get started:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repository, clone, code, push, and then issue a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)
2. Please obtain your own free [Meetup.com API](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) key and replace it in the index.js for local development.

Note that I developed this in Visual Studio 2010 but there is no .sln file in the repo.  This isn't a .NET project, it's all strictly HTML based.
Have fun!
